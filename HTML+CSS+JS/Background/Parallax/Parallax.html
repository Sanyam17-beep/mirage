			<h4 class="stylehead">WeLive</h4>
			<p class="stylepara">WeWork launched a separate but related
				"co-living" venture called WeLive in 2016. WeLive applies the
				same basic principle of WeWork to housing, offering rental
				apartments that are grouped together with a number of shared
				spaces and services, such as cooking, cleaning, and laundry, as
				well as group activities and events. The first tests of the
				concept launched in New York City and also in Crystal City,
				Virginia, near the Ronald Reagan National Airport in the
				Washington metropolitan area.Leaked internal documents from 2014
				stated that WeLive is projected to make up 21% of WeWork's
				revenue by 2018.By the end of 2016, WeLive had mostly phased out
				subsidies for its spaces in New York City under a "friends and
				family" arrangement that discounted rents by 15% to
				20%.Competitors to WeLive include Common, headquartered in New
				York, and HubHaus, headquartered in San Francisco.</p>
